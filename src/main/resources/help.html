<h1>About PGP GUI</h1>
GPGUI is a program wrapping the most fundamental PGP functionality provided via the 
<a href="https://www.bouncycastle.org/about/"> Bouncy Castle</a> API in a GUI.
Functionality such as create/list/delete/import key, encrypt/decrypt
message and file is exposed by the program.
<p>
The program tries to access and used the key ring files defined by <a href="https://www.gnupg.org">GnuPG</a>.
Having GnuPG installed is however optional.
GPGUI i.e this program is maintaining its own public and secret key ring files so GPGUI can operate on its own without having GnuPG installed.
<p>
<h2>List Keys</h2>
Lists either public or secret keys in GnuPG and/or in PGP GUI key ring files.
The <i>Key Ring</i> attribute tells what key ring file the key belongs to i.e. GnuPG or PGP GUI.
<p>
By double clicking on a key you'll see a menu to expand or delete the key.
 
<h2>Create Keys</h2>
Dialog for creating and asymmetric key inclusive an encryption subkey. The algorithms available are RSA or DSA/ELGAM.
The key can be saved in GnuPG key ring files if being installed or in the PGP GUI own key ring files.

<h2>Import Key</h2>
Armored key can be imported to the GnuPG key ring files, if being available or in the PGP GUI key ring files.

<h2>Encrypt Message/File</h2>
Encrypts a text or a file choosing a receiver public key and an encryption algorithm.
If selecting any of the added on algorithms (see below) i.e. SnowFlake, AESx2, AESx4 or AESx8 the message can only be
decrypted using the PGP GUI program otherwise GnuPG can be used to decrypt the message.

<h2>Decrypt Message/File</h2>
Encrypts an armored text or a file. Trying to find the secret key for decryption in GnuPG or PGP GUI key ring files.

<h2>Setting</h2>
The setting dialog allows the locations of the GnuPG and PGP GUI key ring files to be configured.
In addition it is possible for how long time secret key password should be cached.
